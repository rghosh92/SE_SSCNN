Scale Equivariant Scale Steerable CNN using Group Convolutions

The main code is in main_test.py: Train equivariant (or invariant) networks of your choice on various datasets. 
Note that the datasets would have to be provided as a folder with the appropriate name, and as pickle files. 

There are two options for the steerable filter dictionary for creating scale-equivariant CNNs:

(i)  Log-Radial Harmonics (Net_steergroupeq_stl10)
(2)  2D Discrete Cosine Transform Basis (Net_steergroupeq_stl10_dctbasi

There are networks for other datasetes as wel (mnist, fashion-mnist and cifar-10).
